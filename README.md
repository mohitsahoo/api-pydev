# api-pydev

API implementation using Flask, currently hosted [here](http://18.222.189.94/books). Check out the examples.

### Problem Statment
We have one file with the name books.csv. The CSV file contains the general information about the
books, like book name, author, year of publication, etc.

1. API will return number of rows requested from the books.csv file.
	- Input : rows=3
	- Output: (JSON)

### Result

2. 2nd API will give freedom to the user to filter and see any data from the file. The user could
only able to filter from the given column list. If a column is not present then a graceful error
message should return. Even if the API didnâ€™t find any filter response then the user should
get a empty response.
	- Input: Ex. (JSON)
		{"authors":"Jesse Grant"}
	- Output: (JSON)
